# Wine-Quality-Prediction
The Wine Quality Prediction project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify wines based on their physicochemical properties. Wine quality is influenced by factors such as acidity, alcohol content, pH level, and sugar concentration. By analyzing these characteristics, predictive models can assess wine quality and help in decision-making for winemakers, sellers, and consumers. This project implements various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting, to build an accurate classification model. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains red and white wine samples rated by expert tasters on a quality scale from 0 to 10. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the impact of each feature, followed by model training, evaluation, and optimization using hyperparameter tuning. The goal is to develop a robust model that can reliably predict wine quality based on input features. Additionally, the project provides a user-friendly implementation with scripts for training models and making predictions. Users can install dependencies, train models, and test predictions using simple commands. This project is valuable for wine producers, researchers, and data science enthusiasts interested in applying machine learning in real-world scenarios. Contributions and improvements are welcome through GitHub, making it an open-source effort to enhance wine quality assessment using data-driven approaches.
